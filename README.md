Welcome to my personal site repository. 
This project will start from the basics until the site has the characteristics of a good website. By combining courses to gain knowledge of web development along with graphic design courses, including ux/ui, I hope to give the site a special touch.
Updating the site as soon as I get more knowledge will be a good way to see the progress, not only in software experience but also to see how my design knowledge improve.
